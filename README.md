# Household Carbon Footprint Tracker
# General Description

This project is a simple questionnaire that helps users keep track of the pollution produced by their household.
You’ll answer a short series of questions about your weekly, monthly, and yearly habits — including driving, electricity use, clothing purchases, flights, and recycling.

Once you complete the questionnaire, the program calculates your average carbon footprint (in kg of CO₂) and displays your results.
You can also view previous results and track your progress over time.
